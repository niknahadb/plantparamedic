<div class="abstract-title"><h2>Description</h2></div>
Our product, named the Plant Paramedic, is an automated plant irrigation
system that ensures soil moisture levels are maintained at optimal
levels for ideal plant health. Our product also allows the user to
manually water their plants and receive an email with the moisture level
and a timestamp every time the system stops watering. The soil moisture
sensor reads the values from the soil, which are then sent to the CC3200
using GPIO input. These values are compared against the threshold values
in our code to determine whether the soil is dry or wet, and that
dictates the motor turning on and off. We also set up the IR receiver
for manual control via the AT&amp;T remote. Finally, AWS IoT notifies
the user via email about the current status of the system. All of these
features combined provide the user with an intuitive automated product
that is simple, smooth, and reliable.<br />

The first state of our product, as seen in the State Diagram, is the monitoring or idle state, wherein the soil moisture sensor continually reads values while the IR receiver checks if the "LAST" button on the remote is pressed. Next, when the "LAST" button is pressed, the state changes to the watering state. In this state, the driver board sets the GPIO outputs to high for the motor to pump water. When the "MUTE" button is pressed, the system returns to the monitoring/idle state. If moisture levels are between 0.85 and 1.1, the motor turns on again, and water is pumped into the soil. Once the moisture levels drop below 0.85, the motor stops, and the system returns to the monitoring state.

In our design, the two CC3200s served as bases. One was a monitoring base, and the other was a display. The first launchpad had the soil moisture sensor, IR receiver, DC motor, and water pump attached to it. It also connected to AWS through Wi-Fi to send emails to the user. This board also contained the voltage divider for the soil moisture sensor. The second CC3200 was linked to the monitoring one through UART and displayed the humidity levels on its OLED screen via SPI.

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<p>The first piece of hardware we implemented was the soil moisture
sensor. This was plugged into a comparator which had Vin, GND, and A0.
Vin was connected to VCC, and GND to GND. The A0 pin was wired to pin 60
on our CC3200, which was configured as channel 3 of ADC input. Between
the A0 pin and pin 60, we built a voltage divider circuit using two 3.3k
Ohm resistors because the input voltage exceeded the maximum of 1.4V
that the CC3200 is rated for. The output of the voltage divider circuit
was fed into pin 60, completing the hardware setup for the soil moisture
sensor. For software, we used ADC demo from the TI examples folder to
help build the code for this component. ADC demo contains the code on
how to set up the sensor and manipulate output to your desire. We read
in raw ADC values, multiplied it by 1.4, and then divided that number by
4096 to obtain the humidity level of the soil in voltages.</p>
<p>The DC motor with the driver board was the next hardware component to
be set up. The red and black wires of the motor were inserted into out1
and out2 of the driver board (alternatively, you could use out3 and
out4), and the driver board was powered by the 5V output from the
CC3200. The enable, in1, and in2 were then connected to pins 5, 63, and
64, respectively. These could be configured to any GPIO output pins
using the SysConfig tool. In order for the motor to work, we used the
PWM demo file from the TI examples folder and edited the code to remove
irrelevant functions, retaining only one function that sets enable to
high to turn the motor on and turns it off when enable is low. Setting
up the water pump motor attached to the driver board is very simple. All
you have to do is attach the tube that is included in the package to the
motor, and that is it. The motor is obviously water proof, so you could
drop it in a cup of water and it will push the water through the
tube.</p>
<p>The IR receiver was set up similarly to Lab 3. GND and VCC were
connected to their respective pins, and the output was connected to pin
50 on the CC3200 as GPIO input. The code for this was exactly the same
as Lab 3, which included matching the binary values received from the IR
sensor with the corresponding character being pressed on the AT&amp;T
remote. This code also used SysTick and interrupts extensively to
achieve this. To implement interrupts, you have to set up and register
your interrupt handlers, then create a function called GPIOIntHandler()
that uses binary shifting and interrupts to decode the incoming IR
signals.</p>
<p>The OLED board was connected using SPI to the launchpad, and
corresponding pins were connected accordingly. MOSI, CLK, DC, CS, and
RESET were the only pins we needed to connect (excluding VCC and GND).
The code to set up the OLED board included setting up SPI Communication,
as well as making sure the correct pins are assigned to the write and
read commands in Adafruit_OLED.c. To enable UART communication across
both CC3200 launchpads, we first set up UART communication using the
code from previous labs on registering and enabling.connected the first
CC3200’s RX to the second CC3200’s TX, and its TX to the second’s RX. We
also connected a common ground between the two launchpads.</p>
<p>The next step is to set up the CC3200 to connect AWS Servers. If you
already haven't done so in lab 4, you need to create an Amazon AWS
account to access the AWS IoT Console. Create a Thing, representing your
physical device, and save the REST API endpoint address. Generate and
download the required certificates: public key, private key, RootCA
certificate, and any other certificates, and ensure they are activated.
Set up a device shadow to represent the CC3200 in the cloud, and
configure the necessary permissions. Create a new policy in Secure
Policies and attach it to the certificate. Convert your private key and
certificates from .pem to .der format using openSSL, and update your
CC3200 to the latest service pack with UniFlash. Flash the .der
certificates and private key to the board using UniFlash. Configure the
SimpleLink socket library with the correct socket credentials and
connect the board to the internet in common.h. Update the date and time
variables in main.c to validate the credentials.</p>
<p>To send an email, you need to essentially send it as a POST request.
Please refer to the main.c in aws-rest-api-ssl-demo for the function on
how to send a POST request called http_post(). This function initializes
buffers for the request and server response, sets up headers and content
length, and appends the actual data to be sent in the POST body. The
constructed POST request is sent over the TLS socket using sl_Send(),
with error handling for the send and receive operations. The function
then prints the server's response to UART for debugging and returns 0
upon successful execution.</p>
<p>Please refer to our circuit schematic below for all the components,
wire connections, and pins.</p>

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p>The initial challenge we faced during our implementation was that the
CC3200 was supplying too much input voltage to our soil moisture sensor,
causing it to consistently read the maximum voltage of 1.4 V instead of
the actual moisture level. To solve this problem, we constructed a
voltage divider on our board to reduce the input voltage from the
CC3200. By doing so, we were finally able to obtain accurate readings
from our soil moisture sensor.</p>
<p>Another challenge we encountered was our DC motor driver board
inconsistently powering on and off. Debugging this issue was more
complex, as it was a hardware-related problem. When we switched to a
different driver board, it only worked as intended for a few minutes
before reverting to the inconsistent behavior we had been
troubleshooting earlier. We were able to narrow down the issue and
discovered that when the water pump turned on, one of the input wires
connected to the pump would become dislodged. When the wire disconnected
even for half a second, it triggered an input/output error in our
program, halting the entire process. To prevent the wire from loosening
so often, we stripped it a bit more and fully tightened the screws on
the driver board to hold it down. However, the initial startup of the
water pump still caused the wire to move slightly. We finally resolved
this issue by securing the wire so that it would not move at all when
the pump powered on. After this, we no longer experienced any
input/output errors or program stalls.</p>
<p>The third obstacle we faced was an unresponsive IR receiver sensor.
This issue took longer to resolve as we initially believed it was a
software-related problem. However, after replacing the old IR receiver
with a new one, it worked as expected.</p>
<p>There were no other significant challenges or obstacles throughout
the design and implementation process. The majority of the code we used
from previous labs worked as expected, and there were no issues with
connecting and communicating to AWS.</p>
<h1 id="future-work">Future Work</h1>
<p>To further improve the design and user interface (UI) of our project,
we would have liked to add a more interactive UI to our OLED by
including more content, user control, and animations. This would include
a welcome screen, a main menu to select between manual and automatic
control, as well as a watering animation every time the plant is being
watered. Currently, the OLED simply displays the live reading of the
soil humidity level, so there is very little interaction between the
user and our OLED display. Also during the demo, one of the lab members
had to position the tube and water pump towards the plant since it was
taller than where our boards were placed on the table. So we would also
like to attach a frame for the tube and motor to rest on, eliminating
the need for someone to hold the tube upright, thereby improving the
overall efficiency of the system.</p>
